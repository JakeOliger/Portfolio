# Jake Oliger's Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my GitHub and my [portfolio website](https://jakeoliger.com). It's made with Laravel, as you can see in this repository. The website itself isn't anything terribly creative or complex, but it's made and configured entirely by me. I host it on a DigitalOcean droplet, managing the GNU/Linux server myself.
